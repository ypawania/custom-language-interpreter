- build an interpreter (no repls, only run files)
- make the kwywords customizable
- frontend to change kwywords
- gpt to custom generate keywords for you  
- button to generate random curses esolang + coding challenge in it: langroulette -> use gpt


impact: 
- most people use programming languages, but this lets people build their own:
    learn how languages and interpreters work on the lower level
- customize your own language to suit your coding style
- non eurocentric programming languages:
    making programming more accessible by letting people code in their native lang / style:
    ie. HingiLang, TagalogLang, etc.
